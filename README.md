## Project Description *(Software Lead)*

Our project is a variation of a brick-breaker game.

***    

## User Interface Design *(Front End Specialist)*

![User Interface Design](assets/interface_draft1.jpg)
* A start menu, in-game interface, and game over menu for our block breaker game.
* The start menu is a simple "start" button.
* The in-game interface will consist of a player-controlled platform which bounces the block breaker ball, and the ball itself.
* The game over menu displays after no balls are left on screen, and after a delay, transitions back into the start menu.

***        

## Program Design *(Backend Specialist)*

* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. >>
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>

## Project Structure *(Software Lead)*

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:

* main.py
* src
    * <all of your python files should go here>
* assets
    * <all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here)
* etc
    * <This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project. Your demo video should go here.>

## Tasks and Responsibilities *(Software Lead)*

   * You must outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.
